  GFX_SPEVNT_greater_germanic_state_goebbels_DESC:0 "A shocking development few expected has just happened. Paul Josef Goebbels, the Volksführer of Germany has officially proclaimed [GRU.GetNameDef]. Leader of the NMDVP, a minor fraction of the leftist coalition that overthrew the Kaiser's government, few have even considered, let alone expected his rapid rise to power.\n\n What happens next, nobody, except the Volksführer, truly knows."

  GFX_SPEVNT_endsieg_goebbels_DESC:0 "The Germanic army seems unstoppable, having marched all the way to the tips of Scandandinavia and Edges of Eastern Europe, the Germanic State has secured its grip over Europe. The Conquered territories in the east have become nothing but colonies for the germanic people to settle in, with the local populace suffering the horrors of occupation. Many wonder for how long this peace will last, but one thing is sure-\n\n The New Order is here."

  GFX_SPEVNT_ger_civl_REMARK:0 "The Reich will never spread its wings again."
  GFX_SPEVNT_ger_civl_DESC:0 "Sensational news comes from the once mighty ruler of Europe. After the Kaiser's criminal and painfully helpless “struggle” against the Black Monday economic crisis, a struggle in which he effectively betrayed his own people by abandoning them to their fate, he felt just retribution. With the onset of mass starvation, rebel leaders announced the beginning of the “Second Great November Revolution.” Local Freikor units were the first to join the bloodbath. Days passed, but an indomitable wave of retribution swept German cities, directly carrying the threat to the Kaiser's mutts. It was now obvious that Germany had descended into a bloody civil war, and what would happen next was unknown. The French Commune and the British Union urgently convened a congress, at which they announced their full support for the revolutionaries and sent humanitarian and military aid...\n\n§VOne thing can be said:§!"

  GFX_SPEVNT_Second_Weltkrieg_goebbels_DESC:0 "For two decades, Germany and the Third Internationale have been at peace. Despite their ideological opposition to each other, the horrors of the Great War weighed on all - and neither side was prepared to repeat them. Not everyone was convinced that this would last.\n\nToday, the sceptics were proven correct: after years of rising militarisation and challenges to the German world order, Berlin has accused the Internationale of trying to undermine peace and stability in Europe and abroad, and declared its intent to put down its revolutionary governments by force. As Paris and her allies swear vengeance against reaction, French positions near Verdun, Nancy, and more have come under fire once again - the inauguration of the second great war in a generation to shake the continent of Europe."

  GFX_SPEVNT_gru_entry:0 "War in Central Europe"
  GFX_SPEVNT_gru_entry_TEXT:0 "The German people are an iron people. They cannot be conquered through weapons. They can only be conquered through their own weaknesses. \n §Y-Paul Josef Goebbels-§!"
  GFX_SPEVNT_gru_entry_REMARK:0 "Die Zukunft gehört uns!"
  GFX_SPEVNT_gru_entry_DESC:0 "For years, the tension between the Austrian Empire and the radical regime of Joseph Goebbels in Berlin has simmered beneath the surface. Goebbels denounced the Austrian Empire as a bastion of oppression and called upon the workers and oppressed peoples of the Empire to rise against their rulers. As the armies of Berlin clash with the defenders of the Habsburg monarchy, the fragile peace in Central Europe is shattered. The time for diplomacy is over—\n\n The time for war has begun."

  GFX_SPEVNT_GRU_Total_War:0 "Total War Against Syndicalism"
  GFX_SPEVNT_GRU_Total_War_TEXT:0 "Syndicalism is not a revolution of the workers—it is a revolution against them. \n §Y-Paul Josef Goebbels-§!"
  GFX_SPEVNT_GRU_Total_War_REMARK:0 "Totaler Krieg, totaler Sieg!"
  GFX_SPEVNT_GRU_Total_War_DESC:0 "In a fiery speech broadcast across the nation, Joseph Goebbels has called for nothing less than the complete mobilization of his people in a crusade against the syndicalist menace. Delivered in front of a roaring crowd in Berlin, his words echoed through the halls of history, urging his followers to embrace their struggle with unrelenting determination.\n\nThe speech has electrified his supporters, spurring the people into action as factories churn out weapons and soldiers march toward the front. Yet it has also sparked fear among his enemies, who now brace themselves for the full force of Goebbels’ war machine. The world watches with bated breath as Germany vows to end syndicalism once and for all—by any means necessary."
